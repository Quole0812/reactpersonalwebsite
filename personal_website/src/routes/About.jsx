      <p>Hi, I'm Jackson a computer science student at the University of Virginia with a strong interest in AI, data science, and software engineering. I’ve had the opportunity to work across a range of industries, from building conversational AI systems for the insurance tech sector to developing mobile health applications tailored for pregnancy wellness.
My technical strengths lie in Python, Java, and backend development, with hands-on experience in frameworks like Django, Flutter, and cloud services like AWS and Firebase. I’ve led and contributed to several impactful projects, including machine learning models for recidivism prediction, scalable mobile apps, and event management platforms for student organizations.
Beyond coding, I’m passionate about photography, cooking, and traveling. I’m always curious about learning and building meaningful tech solutions that improve real lives.
